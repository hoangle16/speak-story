# Speak-Story

Speak-Story is an Express.js project written in TypeScript that enables users to paste a chapter link from supported websites to:

- Crawl the text content of the chapter.
- Convert the chapter text into audio using text-to-speech (TTS).
- Navigate between chapters with `Next` and `Previous` functionalities.
- Automatically move to the next chapter after the current one finishes.
- Set a timer to stop the audio playback.
- Customize the voice, including selecting the voice type and adjusting the speech speed.
